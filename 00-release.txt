Steps to release the FCSys library:

    1.  Address the starred (**), to do (TODO), and under construction
        (UnderConstruction) items in the code (or as many as possible).
        Run 00-list-WIP.sh to list the occurrences of those tags.

    2.  Test FCSys by calling FCSys.Tests.callAll() and simulating
        FCSys.Tests.RunAll.  Update and run the test/checks.mos and
        test/tests.mos scripts.  Address any problems.

    4.  Update and run 00-find-unused.sh to be sure that all quantities and
        references are used in the code.  Remove the unused quantities from
        resources/quantities.xls and update Quantities.mo and
        resources/scripts/units.mos.  Remove the unused references from
        package.mo (FCSys.UsersGuide.References).

    7.  Delete the FCSys/help directory and recreate it using Dymola
        (File->Export->HTML; check "Large image").  Then run the 00-make-doc.sh
        script to apply the stylesheet, make special replacements, and update
        the documentation for the website on the gh-pages branch.  Push the
        gh-pages branch to origin (git push origin gh-pages).

    8.  Use http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ to update the sitemap.  Put it in base
        folder of the the gh-pages branch and push to origin again (git push
        origin gh-pages).  Resubmit it in Google Webmaster tools
        (https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/sitemap-list?hl=en&siteUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fkdavies4.github.com%2FFCSys%2F#MAIN_TAB=1&CARD_TAB=-1).
1/3/13 KD
    9.  Add an entry to the list of revisions in package.mo.  Create and
        include a conversion script if necessary.
    10. Commit the revisions to git.
    11. Create a git tag for the release.
    12. Run 00-release.sh.  Browse the result to be sure that the proper files
        are included and that no undesired files are included.  If necessary,
        update .release-include and .release-exclude and rerun steps 9-11.
