**Warning!**  This package is still in development.  Changes may be made that
affect the public interfaces of the classes.  The package is not yet under full
version control and conversion scripts are not being provided for these
changes.  Some models still have issues or are incomplete.  These models should
be marked with an "under construction" icon (red triangle) or have notes marked
with "TODO" or "**".  If you have problems besides those noted, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/kdavies4/FCSys/issues/new).

[FCSys] is a library of proton exchange membrane fuel cell models in
[Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/).  More information is available in the
documentation, which can be accessed [online](http://kdavies4.github.com/FCSys),
or from the documentation layer of the Modelica code (starting at the
[top level](package.mo)).

### Installation

Please see the
[Getting Started section](http://kdavies4.github.io/FCSys/FCSys_UsersGuide.html#FCSys.UsersGuide.GettingStarted)
of the
[User's Guide](http://kdavies4.github.com/FCSys/FCSys_UsersGuide.html).

There are optional subpackages ([Test](Test.mo) and [Tests](Tests.mo)) to
perform tests on the rest of the library.  They are not included in the
documentation and can be safely removed (but may be helpful for debugging).
